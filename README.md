# Instructions
Congrats! With this repository you are one step closer to making a Minecraft bot with mineflayer! But there are still some things you need to know (and i totally did not just copy my discord bot repository).

Getting started:
- Make sure you have a Minecraft account and you know its email and password.
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- Clone the repository (assuming you have git installed).

To install mineflayer:
- Run "install.bat".
- After you are done with that, you can delete the file.
- Please do not run it more than once!

To run the bot:
- First, open up index.js and edit the lines that say "email@website.com" and "password" and replace those with your Minecraft account's email and password. You can also change the other settings if you'd like.
- Then, run "start.bat" (unlike install.bat, you need to keep this file to run the bot and you can open it as many times as you'd like).

Additional Steps:
- What has already been coded will make the bot say "Hello" in the chat box.
- If you already know basic javascript you can figure out how to change what the bot does, what it says, etc by reading the documentation [here.](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/api.md)
- It is also possible to create a viewer so you can view your bot's pov, instructions can be found [here.](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer)
