# Instructions
Congrats! With this repository you are one step closer to making a Minecraft bot with mineflayer! But there are still some things you need to know (and i totally did not just copy my discord bot repository).

Getting started:
- Make sure you have a Minecraft account and you know its email and password.
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- Create a new folder called Minecraft Bot and put it somewhere you can find it easily.
- Download the file "index.js" and put it inside the folder.

To install mineflayer:
- Open up a terminal.
- Navigate to your bot's folder(the folder you created).
- If you have Node.js installed, type in "npm init"
- Follow the steps
- If you want to skip a step because what's already provided is correct, just press enter.
- Please skip the entry point, test command, git repository, keywords and license steps as they are not neccessary.
- After you are done with "npm init", type in "npm install mineflayer"
- Congratulations, dimineflayer has been installed.

To run the bot:
- First, open up index.js and edit the lines that say "email@website.com" and "password" and replace those with your Minecraft account's email and password. You can also change the other settings if you'd like.
- Open up a terminal.
- Navigate to the bot's folder using "cd (file path)"
- If you have Node.js installed, type in "node ."
- You will know the bot is online when the message saying the bot is online appears in the terminal.

Additional Steps:
- What has already been coded will make the bot say "Hello" in the chat box.
- If you already know basic javascript you can figure out how to change what the bot does, what it says, etc by reading the documentation [here.](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/docs/api.md)
- It is also possible to create a viewer so you can view your bot's pov, instructions can be found [here.](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer)
